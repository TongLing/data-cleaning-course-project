#Getting and Cleaning Data

##Course Project

Hello welcome to have a look at my code! Here I create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Steps to work on this course project

Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
Run source("Run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file tiny_data.txt in the working directory.
